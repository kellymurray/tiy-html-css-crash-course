## What is HTML?

* **HyperText** is the method by which you move around on the web by clicking on special text called hyperlinks. Hyper just means it's not linear - i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links - there is no set order to do things in.

* **Markup** is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (italicised text, for example).

* HTML is a **Language**, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.
