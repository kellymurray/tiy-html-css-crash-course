## What is HTML?

* **HyperText** is the method by which you move around on the web by clicking on special text called hyperlinks. Hyper just means it's not linear - i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links - there is no set order to do things in.

* **Markup** is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (italicised text, for example).

* HTML is a **Language**, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.

```HTML
<element="attribute">
</closetag>
```

```HTML
  <p>Cats are cool!</p>
```

And sometimes there's self-closing tags...

```HTML
<img src="http://placebear.com/g/400/200" />
```

## What is CSS?

* Cascading Style Sheets.

* CSS defines how HTML elements are displayed. It can't be used without HTML.

* Primary purpose: separating content from design.

* CSS should always be written after your basic HTML.

## CSS Selectors

* What is a selector and how does it look on the page?

	* Basic CSS consists of three parts:

```css
			selector {
				property: value;
			}
```
```css
			body {
  			background: DodgerBlue;
  			font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, serif;
			}
```
